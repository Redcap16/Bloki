# Bloki
## Overview
Bloki is a simple game, inspired by well known voxel game - Minecraft. It's written in C++ with use of pure OpenGL and WinAPI. It also makes some use of Freetype, GLM and few other libraries. Currently game features block placing/destroying, world creation (with support of generating structures of unlimited size), saving/loading worlds from files and early support of items and inventory. Also, world loading, generating and saving is done using multithreading, which makes the game run smoothly. Currently I'm working to complete the inventory mechanics. Next things will be lighting and skybox, to improve the look.
